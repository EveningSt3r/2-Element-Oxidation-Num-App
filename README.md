# 2-Element-Oxidation-Num-App
Work in progress for a bigger project, but I thought I'd honor it with its own repo
This application gets you oxidation numbers for compounds with 2 elements including Oxygen (like Nitrate) 
Yeah I took chem
This application is limited functionality due to the fact that I plan on exploring oxidation number stuff more later, and for now just wanted to publish this. Enjoy.
I will publish a Jar eventually when I'm motivated enough to
